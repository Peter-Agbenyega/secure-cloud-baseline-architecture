# Secure Cloud Baseline Architecture for U.S. Organizations

## Overview

This repository documents an open, non-commercial cloud security reference architecture
designed to help organizations establish a secure baseline when adopting cloud infrastructure.

The goal of this work is to reduce security risks caused by misconfiguration, insufficient
access controls, and lack of visibility in cloud environments.



## Problem Statement

Cloud adoption across U.S. organizations has accelerated rapidly, but many security incidents
continue to stem from preventable architectural weaknesses, including:

- Overly permissive identity and access policies
- Lack of centralized logging and monitoring
- Inconsistent security controls across environments
- Manual configuration drift over time

These issues increase exposure to data breaches, service disruptions, and compliance failures.



## Proposed Solution

This project provides a secure-by-design cloud baseline architecture that emphasizes:

- Least-privilege identity and access management
- Centralized security logging and monitoring
- Network isolation and controlled access boundaries
- Repeatable infrastructure patterns aligned with security best practices

The architecture is designed to be reusable, scalable, and adaptable across organizations.


## Scope of Reference Architecture

The reference design focuses on:

- Secure AWS account and environment structure
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) baseline
- Network segmentation and access control
- Logging, monitoring, and auditability
- Infrastructure-as-Code alignment principles

This repository is intentionally non-operational and non-commercial.



## Public Benefit

By publishing security reference architectures openly, this work aims to:

- Improve cloud security posture across organizations
- Reduce preventable security incidents
- Promote repeatable, security-first design practices
- Support broader cybersecurity resilience efforts
